<h2>##Overview</h2>
<p>It is a simple app but full stack app, it is my first full stack app. Before it, I was involved in front-end but in this project I learned about about back-end as well. I made MongoDB atlas and connected database to my server. Though, it is a very simple app but by this I learned how to a full stack app works.</p>

<h2>##Tech Stacks</h2>
<ul>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>React</li>
  <li>Node</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>I used reactStrap which was very new to me, it was fun working on this project as a whole.</p>
